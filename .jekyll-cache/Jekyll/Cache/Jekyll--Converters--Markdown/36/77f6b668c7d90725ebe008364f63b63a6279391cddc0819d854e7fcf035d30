<p>The goal of this project is to get matchup data from your Yahoo Fantasy league. I have a fatasy hockey league with my best friends that has been running for over 10 years and we all wanted to see the historical stats. To get the data, we will first be using the Yahoo Fantasy API, then transform it from XML data to tabular data using Python.</p>
